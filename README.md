# Advent Of Code

Repo that contains my solutions to the advent of code

## Languages

Currently I'm aiming at doing everything with ruby since it's a language that I'm familiar with and it's easy to do
these kind of "scripts" with. I would love to do it with static languages like kotlin, java or golang but I don't want
to have a huge amount of setup so that the IDE can help me with the code.

## Structure

I'm currently using the [aoc-to-markdown](https://github.com/antonio-ramadas/aoc-to-markdown) library so that i can
download the problem description and the input.

For example for the year 2021 and the day 5 I'd execute `aoc-to-markdown -y 2021 -d 5 -o 2021 -i` so that the util would
download the problem in the folder 2021

Although I use a script to setup every day so that i avoid myself copying and pasting the same template over and over
again.
