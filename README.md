# Advent Of Code

Repo that contains my solutions to the advent of code

## Languages
I do these problems to learn new things, so I won't do all of them in the same language. I'd do them either the language
that I need to get experience for a particular project or a language that i'd like to learn.

## Structure
I'm currently using the [aoc-to-markdown](https://github.com/antonio-ramadas/aoc-to-markdown) library so that i can download the problem description and the input. 

For example for the year 2021 and the day 5 I'd execute `aoc-to-markdown -y 2021 -d 5 -o 2021 -i` so that the util would download the problem in the folder 2021
