# Advent Of Code

Repo that contains my solutions to the advent of code

## Languages

Currently I'm aiming at doing everything with ruby since it's a language that I'm familiar with and it's easy to do
these kind of "scripts" with. I would love to do it with static languages like kotlin, java or golang but I don't want
to have a huge amount of setup so that the IDE can help me with the code.

## Structure

I'm currently using the [aoc2md](https://github.com/kevinrobayna/aoc2md) cli so that I can
download the problem description and the input.

For example for the year 2021 and the day 5 I'd execute `aoc2md -y 2021 -d 5` so that the cli would
download the problem in the folder 2021

Although I use a script to setup every day so that I avoid myself copying and pasting the same template over and over
again.
